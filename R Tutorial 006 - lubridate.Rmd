```{r Load Libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13) 
library(lubridate)
```

We will explore the "lubridate" package of the tidyverse. In this tutorial we will do the following things:

1)  Creating date & datetime objects
2)  Isolating components of the datetime
3)  Time spans (durations, periods, intervals)

### Creating datetime objects

Two key functions to be aware of are `today()` and `now()`. Observe the results:

```{r Today function}
day <- today()
str(day)
```

The `today()` function returns the current date, and it is an object of class "Date".

```{r Now function}
datetime <- now()
str(datetime)
```

The `now()` function requires the current datetime. This is an object of class "POSIXct". "POSIXct" is the most common class in R for datetimes. These store the number of seconds since an origin point of "1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC", whereas the "Date" class stores the number of days since "1970-01-01".

Now, let's suppose these were stored as strings.

```{r Creating dates and datetimes as strings}
string1 <- "2020-09-22"
string2 <- "2020-09-22 17:00:00"
str(string1)
str(string2)
```

These are automatically stored as strings. Compare the following approaches now though:

```{r Converting strings to dates and datetimes}
date1 <- as.Date(string1)
date2 <- as_date(string1)
datetime1 <- as.POSIXct(string2)
datetime2 <- as_datetime(string2)
str(date1)
str(date2)
str(datetime1)
str(datetime2)
```

The functions `as.Date()` and `as.POSIXct()` come from base R. However, the `as_date()` and `as_datetime()` functions come from "lubridate". However, `as_datetime()` is a little easier to write and remember than `as.POSIXct()`!

Now suppose you have dates in some different formats. lubridate comes with helper functions like `ymd()`, `mdy()`, `dmy()` with extensions such as `ymd_h()`, `ymd_hm()`, and `ymd_hms()`, for the "year", "minute", "day", "hour", "minute", and "second" components.

```{r Helper functions}
dateFormat1 <- "20200922"
dateFormat2 <- "09-22-2020"
dateFormat3 <- "22/09/2020"
dateFormat4 <- "09-22-2020 17:00:00"
dateFormat5 <- "20200922 170000"
ymd(dateFormat1)
mdy(dateFormat2)
dmy(dateFormat3)
mdy_hms(dateFormat4)
ymd_hms(dateFormat5)
```

### Isolating components of the datetime

Let's look at today's date. There are number of functions such as `year()`, `month()`, `mday()` (day of the month), `hour()`, `minute()`, `second()`, as well as helper functions like `yday()` and `wday()`.

```{r Component functions}
todayDate <- "2020-09-22 17:15:00"
year(todayDate)
month(todayDate)
mday(todayDate)
hour(todayDate)
minute(todayDate)
second(todayDate)
yday(todayDate)
wday(todayDate)
```

With the functions `month()` and `wday()`, you can specify the argument `label = TRUE`. Observe:

```{r Component functions with labels}
month(todayDate, label = TRUE)
wday(todayDate, label = TRUE)
```

Let's illustrate the usefulness of these functions by loading the `flights` data and creating a couple visualizations.

```{r Create dataset}
data <- flights %>%
  dplyr::select(flight, carrier, time_hour)
data
```

First, let's create a bar chart of the count of flights by month:

```{r Bar plot example}
data %>%
  mutate(month = month(time_hour, label = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = month), fill = "navy", color = "gold")
```

Next, let's create a line plot for flights by hour of the day:

```{r Line plot example}
data %>%
  mutate(hour = hour(time_hour)) %>%
  group_by(hour) %>%
  tally() %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = hour, y = n)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 24, 4))
```

<br>

### Time spans (durations, periods, intervals)

The definition of these three classes are as follows:

-   Durations measure the exact number of seconds that occur between two instants.
-   Periods measure the change in clock time that occurs between two instants.
-   Intervals are timespans representing a start and an end point.

Let's see the difference within the month March 2020.

```{r Creating a difftime object}
startDate <- as_datetime("2020-03-01 00:00:00")
endDate <- as_datetime("2020-03-31 23:59:59")
difftime <- endDate - startDate
difftime
```

```{r Examples of the three classes}
as.duration(difftime)
as.period(difftime)
as.interval(startDate, endDate)
```

Durations make it easy to add durations of time to existing datetimes. They come with a variety of helper functions such as `dseconds()`, `dminutes()`, `dhours()`, `ddays()`, `dweeks()`, `dmonths()`, and `dyears()`.\
Periods are similar and come with similar helper functions: `seconds()`, `minutes()`, `hours()`, `days()`, `months()`, `weeks()`, and `years()`. Here are examples that will return the same result:

```{r Duration and period examples}
startDate + dhours(5)
startDate + minutes(300)
```

However, here is an example where they will return DIFFERENT results:

```{r Discrepancy between duration and period}
stTime <- ymd_hms("2020-03-07 12:00:00", tz = "America/New_York")
stTime + ddays(1)
stTime + days(1)
```

Note that R is very sensitive to Daylight Savings Time. The duration function `ddays()` added the number of seconds in a typical day to the original date. However, March 7, 2020 only had 23 hours due to the presence of Daylight Savings Time. The difference with the period function `days()` is that it added the natural human day -- which, when we think of a day, will be the same hour of the following day despite Daylight Savings Time.

Intervals also come with a variety of helper functions like `int_start()`, `int_end()`, `int_flip()`, `int_shift()`, `int_overlaps()`, `int_standardize()`, `int_aligns()`, and `int_diff()`. These can be accessed through the help documentation and are fairly intuitive.
